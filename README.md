# Sinch - Topic Modelling/Clustering

- ~~Redo the roadmap and organise observations in two parts (with full input and reduced input).~~
- ~~Fix the issue with italic text slide 23.~~
- ~~Understand why the basic Lbl2Vec model is random and how to choose the number of iterations to compute an average.~~
- See the impact of the number of keywords choosen for the Doc2Vec-based model with spaCy and how this number varies with datasets.
- Evaluate the performances between Lbl2Vec and Lbl2TransformerVec
- ~~Get informations about how spaCy similarity works.~~
- Get the limitations of the problem.
    - Find other models (that either tries to solve these limitations or have another approach).
    - Think about potential solutions of these problems.
- Redo the experiments with simple clustering (TF-IDF + KMeans).
- Make a summary slide for each model (with the input, output and limitations).

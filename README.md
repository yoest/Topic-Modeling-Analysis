# Sinch - Topic Modelling/Clustering

## Topic Clustering

- See the assignment confidence of Lbl2Vec and put that in relation with the wrong prediction. Is the model always confident on wrong prediction ? Are we able to detect the data point that will be problematic ?

## Topic Modelling

- Compare LDA and BERTopic on multiple datasets based on all the metric.
- For BERTopic:
    - Are other transformer (maybe more recent) sentence transformer than SBERT to use ?
    - Are there other dimensionality reduction methods than UMAP that can be used ?
    - Are there other clustering methods than HDBSCAN that can be used ?
- vONTSS ?

## Misc

- Create a flow of idea globally (i.e. add questions ?) to better understand questions that I had and why did I try one thing or another
